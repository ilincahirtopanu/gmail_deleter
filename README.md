you can select an sender in your gmail from whom you want to delete all emails. 
npm install http-server

change the API key and the client ID to whatever yours is, details on how to get to them incoming.

to run: npx http-server -p 8000



future edits:
be able to undo deletes?
unsubscribe from this email button too? so it kills two birds with one stone
